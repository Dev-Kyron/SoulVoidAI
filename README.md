## Why VoidSoul

Today's AI apps split awkwardly:

- **Cloud chatbots** can't touch your machine.
- **Editor copilots** are trapped in one IDE.
- **Closed ecosystems** lock you to one vendor and one model.

VoidSoul is the third path — a single persistent assistant that's always there, can do real work on your computer, speaks every major model, never sends your data anywhere you didn't tell it to, and grows with you through plugins, MCP servers, and per-mode memory.

> **It's not a better chatbot. It's an operating layer that turns whatever AI you pay for into Jarvis.**

## 🚀 Quick start

### Download

Grab the latest installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Dev-Kyron/SoulVoidAI/releases) — Windows `.exe`, macOS `.dmg`, or Linux `.AppImage`.

> First-launch heads-up: Windows SmartScreen may flag an unsigned indie binary. Click **More info → Run anyway** to install. macOS users: right-click the `.dmg` → **Open** the first time. Signed builds are on the roadmap once initial revenue covers the cert.

### Or run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dev-Kyron/SoulVoidAI.git
cd SoulVoidAI
npm install
npm run icons     # generate orb / tray icons
npm run dev       # boot the app with HMR
```

**Prerequisites:** Node 20.18+ (CI runs 22) and platform build tools for `better-sqlite3` (`Python 3.11` + "Desktop development with C++" on Windows).

A glowing orb appears bottom-right of your screen. Click it to expand the command panel; it also lives in your system tray.

### First boot

1. Pick a workflow **mode** (Indie Dev · Creator · Streamer · Researcher · Writer · Productivity) and a Nexus layout
2. The **interactive checklist** walks you through: send a message → press Cmd+F → open mic → open Settings
3. Either install **Ollama** ([ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)) and VoidSoul auto-detects it for free local chat, or paste a provider key in **Settings → AI Providers**

That's it. The orb is alive.

### Build & package

```bash
npm run build          # typecheck + bundle to ./out
npm run package        # build unpacked app into ./release
npm run dist           # full installer (NSIS / DMG / AppImage)
npm run typecheck      # strict TS across main + renderer + shared
npm test               # vitest suite (147+ tests)
```

## 🧠 The memory stack

| Layer | What it remembers | When it triggers |
|---|---|---|
| **Threads** | Every message, every conversation. Named, pinned, full-text searchable across the whole history. | Always on (unless **Private mode** is toggled per chat). |
| **Projects** | Pinned mode + instructions that auto-prepend to every thread in the project. | Per project; per-thread overrides win. |
| **Story-so-far** | Prose recap of older messages in a long conversation, injected into the system prompt. | When estimated tokens exceed ~10k and the chat has ≥8 messages. Cached, regenerated only when stale. |
| **Facts** | Short, durable bullets ("user is solo dev of Spiritless in UE5"). Mode-taggable, capped at 50. | Auto-extracted after every reply (toggleable). Manual entry from Settings → Memory. |
| **RAG** | Embeddings of every persisted message + any indexed files (PDFs, DOCX, code, text). | On every send: retrieves top-K relevant snippets, injects into the system prompt. |

The five layers compose without stepping on each other. Short chats use only Threads; medium ones add Story-so-far; long-history users get RAG; Facts thread through all of them; Projects override the baseline.

---

## 🤖 Agent mode — 18 built-in tools + MCP

Toggle **Agent** in the chat header. The model can call any of these, plus every MCP tool from every connected server:

| Tool | Permission | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `open_app` · `open_url` · `open_folder` | `appControl` · `browser` · `filesystem` | Launch apps, open links and folders |
| `run_shell` | `terminal` | Run shell commands, capped output |
| `list_files` · `read_file` · `write_file` · `organize_folder` | `filesystem` | File I/O (writes are reversible via undo) |
| `type_text` · `send_hotkey` | `inputAccess` | Drive keyboard into any focused window |
| `move_mouse` · `click_mouse` | `inputAccess` | Precise cursor control |
| `read_screen` | `screenCapture` | OCR the screen to text via Tesseract |
| `see_screen` | `screenCapture` | Capture the screen and **look at it** as an image |
| `web_search` | — | DuckDuckGo (keyless) or Tavily (upgrade) |
| `web_fetch` | — | Pull a URL, extract the main content (readability + SSRF guard) |
| `run_python` | `terminal` | Run Python in a sandboxed tmp dir, capped output |
| `generate_image` | — | Pollinations (keyless), DALL·E 3, Stable Diffusion 3, Gemini Imagen 3 |

Plus your **MCP servers**, your **plugin actions**, and any tool you wire in. The agent loop is capped at six steps per turn, runs non-streaming for accuracy, surfaces **live progress** (`Searching the web: "metal vs vulkan"…`), preserves partial content on user-stop, and logs every step to the **Logs** tab — filterable by level + category, searchable.

---

## 👁️ Vision + 🖱️ Input Access

With a vision-capable model (Claude 3+ · GPT-4o · Gemini 1.5+ · LLaVA · MiniCPM-V · Grok-2 vision), `see_screen` captures your screen and attaches the image to the model's next reasoning step — it *looks*, not just OCRs.

Combine with mouse control for true GUI work:

> *"Take a screenshot, find the Build button in the toolbar, click it."*

The agent does: `see_screen` → identifies pixel coordinates → `move_mouse(x, y)` → `click_mouse()`. **The full hands-free loop.**

The model picker flags vision-capable models with an emerald **eye** icon so you never accidentally attach an image to a text-only model — and the composer warns if you do.

---

## 🎙️ Voice — fully local by default

- **Wake word:** keyless local Whisper engine that matches arbitrary phrases ("Hey Void", "Soul"), or upgrade to Porcupine for lower CPU.
- **STT:** local Whisper-tiny via `@xenova/transformers` (no API key needed) — falls back to OpenAI Whisper / Gemini if you've configured them and want quality.
- **TTS:** OS speech-synthesis with named personas — **Void** (male) and **Soul** (female).
- **Barge-in:** speak mid-reply — TTS stops, the mic auto-opens. Same UX shape as ChatGPT voice mode.
- **DND / quiet hours:** auto-suppress voice between configured times.

The default voice loop runs **without sending a byte of audio off your machine.**

---

## 🔌 MCP — the pluggable tool ecosystem

VoidSoul speaks the **Model Context Protocol** as a client. Add any MCP server — community or custom — from **Settings → MCP Servers**:

```
Name:    Filesystem
Command: npx
Args:    -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem C:\Path\To\Project
```

Click *Add & start*. Its tools instantly become callable by the agent. No code changes, no rebuilds.

Tested out of the box with:

- 🗂️ **Filesystem** — search, read, write, list (14 tools)
- 🐙 **GitHub** — issues, PRs, commits, gists, search (26 tools)
- 🎮 **Unreal Engine 5** — custom bridge included in [`tools/ue5-mcp-bridge/`](tools/ue5-mcp-bridge/)

---

## 🌐 Multi-provider — bring your own AI

| Provider | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Anthropic Claude** | Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6/4.5, Haiku 4.5, Claude 3 — vision |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o1, o3-mini — vision |
| **Google Gemini** | 2.0 Flash/Pro, 1.5 Pro/Flash — vision |
| **Ollama** *(local)* | Auto-detected on port 11434. Llama, Qwen, Phi, Mistral, LLaVA, Moondream |
| **LM Studio** *(local)* | Auto-detected on port 1234. Any model you've loaded |
| **llama.cpp** *(local)* | Auto-detected `llama-server` on port 8080. Any GGUF |
| **Groq** | Blisteringly fast — Llama, Mixtral |
| **xAI Grok** | Grok-2, Grok-2 Vision |
| **OpenRouter** | Aggregator — try almost anything |
| **DeepSeek** | Strong coder models |
| **Mistral** | Mistral Large, Codestral |
| **Custom** | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

Switch providers mid-conversation; threads, memory, and tools follow. Pick a **different model per thread** for "this one's for vision, this one's for cheap code Q&A".

---

## 💰 Cost tracking

Every API call is metered, priced against the current model table, and surfaced in **Settings → Usage & Cost**:

- Month-to-date total + per-model breakdown
- Daily-spend bar chart for the current month
- Provider-share stacked bar with legend
- Monthly budget with progress bar + toast alerts at 75/90/100%
- Recent-calls list with tokens in/out per call

Token counts are estimates from text length unless the provider reports actuals; the actual bill takes precedence. Local providers (Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp / custom) are zero-priced.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & permissions

VoidSoul never acts silently. Each capability maps to a permission you grant explicitly and can revoke at any time:

| Permission | Unlocks | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `terminal` | Running shell commands · Python | High |
| `filesystem` | Reading / writing / organising files | High |
| `browser` | Opening URLs | Low |
| `appControl` | Launching apps, foregrounding windows | Medium |
| `inputAccess` | Keyboard + mouse control | High |
| `microphone` | Voice input | Medium |
| `screenCapture` | Screenshots, OCR, vision | Medium |

### Private mode

Toggle the **shield** icon in the chat header. The current conversation:

- Isn't persisted to disk
- Doesn't trigger fact extraction
- Suppresses the screen-awareness line in the system prompt

For sensitive material — IP, personal data, anything you don't want lingering on disk.

### Where your data lives

Everything lives in a local data folder (Settings → About → *Open data folder*) backed by SQLite for chat history + plain JSON for config / memory / plugins / MCP servers. API keys are encrypted via Electron `safeStorage` (Windows DPAPI / macOS Keychain / Linux libsecret) and never leave the main process.

See **[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)** for the full policy — short version: nothing leaves your computer unless you trigger an action that explicitly sends it.

### Backup & sync

**Settings → Backup & Sync** exports the whole setup (config · memory · plugins · chat history · usage · scheduled tasks · MCP servers) as one portable JSON — or writes it to a chosen folder. Point that folder at Dropbox / OneDrive / Google Drive and you have **de-facto cloud sync, using your own cloud**. API keys are deliberately excluded; re-enter them on each machine.

---

## 🧩 Plugins

A plugin is a **declarative JSON workflow pack** — drop a `.json` file into the plugins folder (Settings → Plugins → *Open folder*). It contributes permission-gated quick actions built from the existing action types; it cannot execute arbitrary code, so a plugin is never more dangerous than the actions it bundles.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "spiritless-pack",
  "name": "Spiritless",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Kyron",
  "description": "Shortcuts for my UE5 game.",
  "quickActions": [
    {
      "id": "open-engine",
      "label": "Open UE5",
      "icon": "Gamepad2",
      "description": "Launch the editor on Spiritless.",
      "requires": "appControl",
      "action": {
        "type": "open-app",
        "params": { "app": "C:/Epic/UE_5.4/Engine/Binaries/Win64/UnrealEditor.exe" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Invalid manifests surface their validation error rather than being silently dropped.

## ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | What |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Space` | Summon / hide the widget |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + J` | Open the **Quick AI** overlay from anywhere |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + F` | Cross-thread search |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + K` | Command palette |
| `Enter` | Send a message |
| `Shift + Enter` | Newline in the composer |
| `Esc` | Close any open dialog |

## 🆚 vs. the vendor apps

VoidSoul **uses** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and the rest under the hood — it doesn't replace them. It gives them a **body** they don't have:

|  | VoidSoul | ChatGPT Desktop | Claude Desktop | Raycast | LM Studio |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Multi-provider in one app | ✅ 12 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Open / drive YOUR apps & files | ✅ | sandbox | beta | ❌ | ❌ |
| See your real screen | ✅ | ❌ | beta | ❌ | ❌ |
| Drive mouse + keyboard | ✅ | ❌ | beta | ❌ | ❌ |
| MCP support | ✅ GUI | ❌ | ✅ JSON | ❌ | ✅ |
| Local-first defaults | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Memory across vendors | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Floating orb / global hotkey | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Mac only | ❌ |
| Workflow modes | ✅ 6 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Custom plugins | ✅ | limited | ⚠️ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Voice loop (wake → STT → reply → TTS) | ✅ local | partial | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cost tracking dashboard | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Per-token cost only | ✅ | $20/mo | $20/mo | $8/mo | free |

Use the official apps for their sandboxed exploration. Use VoidSoul when you want the AI to **actually do things** in your environment.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Stack**

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Desktop shell | Electron 33 |
| Build tooling | electron-vite · Vite 5 |
| UI | React 18 · TypeScript strict · TailwindCSS · Framer Motion |
| State | Zustand |
| Storage | SQLite (better-sqlite3) + atomic JSON |
| AI providers | 12 — unified behind one `AIProvider` interface |
| Embeddings | Local `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (worker), or OpenAI / Ollama |
| Markdown | react-markdown + remark-gfm + remark-math + rehype-katex + mermaid + highlight.js |
| OCR | tesseract.js (WASM) |
| MCP | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` |
| Auto-update | electron-updater + GitHub Releases |
| Tests | Vitest, 147+ tests, CI on Windows + macOS + Linux |

**Three processes, one contract.** `src/shared/` holds the types. The preload exposes a single typed `window.voidsoul` bridge; the renderer never touches Node, the network, or the filesystem directly.

**Modular services.** Each `src/main/services/*` folder is self-contained. Adding a provider, an action, or a memory layer means adding a file — not editing a monolith.
